// Exercise 6 : Bank Details
// Instructions
// In this exercise, you have to decide which type of variables you have to use (ie. let or const):

// Create a global variable called bankAmount which value is the amount of money currently in your account.
// Create a variable that saves the % amount of VAT (In Israel, itâ€™s 17%).
// Create an array with all your monthly expenses, both positive and negative (money made and money spent).
// Example : const details = ["+200", "-100", "+146", "+167", "-2900"]
// Create a program that modifies the expenses (ie. the positive AND the negative expenses) so that they will include taxes (multiply each expense by the VAT).
// Display your current bankAccount standing at the end of the month.

let bankAmount=3500;
const vat =0.17;
const details = ["+200", "-100", "+146", "+167", "-2900"]
const account=(details)=>{
    details.forEach((element,index,array) => bankAmount+=(Number(array[index])*vat));
}

account(details);
console.log(bankAmount);
